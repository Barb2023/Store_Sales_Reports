# 🎯 Superstores Sales Report  #


In this project I will be using Python(EDA) and Power BI to show several information of the Store orders made in four consecutive years from different countries.

---
# 🎯 Context #

* A superstore is a very large store often offering a wide variety of merchandise for sale. Superstores typically charge anywhere from 15 to 45 percent less than their smaller counterparts. 
As the decision maker for a superstore company, we will give some insights into what works best to understand which products, regions, categories, and customer segments they should target or avoid.

We will try to find out the weak areas and see where Superstores can make more profit.
Using the dataset, we will also do an EDA and try to build a Regression model to predict Sales or Profit.


* The dataset will include Products,Sales, Profit, Country, Region and all sales order details for reporting.
